In this project, I will illustrate with examples what enum and typedef keyword are used for in C. The keyword enum represents enumeration. It is a user define data type, mainly used to assign names to integral constants which makes a program readable and maintainable. The syntax: enum variable_name {values...}; Kindly check the example code to understand how I did it. Typedef on the other hand, allows you to create own data types in C. For instance you can declare INTEGER as synonyms for the int data type: typedef int INTEGER; Then you can start to use INTEGER to declare integer variables like this: INTEGER i, j; which is equivalent to int i, j; This special keyword is used to assign alternative names to an existing data type. Kindly check the example code for how I illustrated it
