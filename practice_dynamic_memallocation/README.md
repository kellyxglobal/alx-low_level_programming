Dynamic Memoery Allocation.
This project is all about allocating memory dynamically in C using the four C library functions.

Dynamic memory allocation
Since C is a structured language, it has some fixed rules for programming. One of them includes changing the size of an array. An array is a collection of items stored at contiguous memory locations. 

Let's say we have the below information.
Array length = 7
First Index = 0
Last index = 6

As it can be seen that the length (size) of the array above made is 7. But what if there is a requirement to change this length (size) by increasing or decreasing it? This procedure is known as dynamic Memor Allocation in C.

There are four basic libraries functions in C which I illustrated in this project. They include;
1) Malloc()
2) Calloc()
3) Free()
4) realloc()

You can check out the source code to see how this is programmed.
